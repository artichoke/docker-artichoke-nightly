Nightly builds of Artichoke Ruby.

Artichoke is a Ruby implementation written in Rust and Ruby. Artichoke intends
to be [MRI-compatible][ruby-spec] and targets Ruby 2.6.3. Artichoke provides a
Ruby runtime implemented in Rust and Ruby.

[ruby-spec]: https://github.com/ruby/spec

## Install Artichoke

Pull and run the latest image:

```console
$ docker run -it docker.io/artichokeruby/artichoke airb
```

### Platforms

Currently supported docker platforms are:

- `ubuntu` - canonical mainline Ubuntu 20.04 Focal Fossa image, tagged with
  `latest`, `ubuntu-nightly`, `ubuntu-focal-nightly`, and `ubuntu20.04-nightly`.
- `debian-slim` - Debian 11 (Bullseye) slim image, tagged `slim-nightly` and
  `slim-bullseye-nightly`.
- `alpine` - Alpine 3 image, tagged with `alpine-nightly` and `alpine3-nightly`.

## Usage

Artichoke ships with two binaries: `airb` and `artichoke`.

### `airb`

`airb` is the Artichoke implementation of `irb` and is an interactive Ruby shell
and [REPL].

`airb` is a readline-enabled shell, although it does not persist history.

[repl]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop

### `artichoke`

`artichoke` is the `ruby` binary frontend to Artichoke.

`artichoke` supports executing programs via files, stdin, or inline with one or
more `-e` flags.

Artichoke can `require`, `require_relative`, and `load` files from the local
file system, but otherwise does not yet support local file system access. A
temporary workaround is to inject data into the interpreter with the
`--with-fixture` flag, which reads file contents into a `$fixture` global.

```console
$ artichoke --help
artichoke 0.1.0-pre.0
Artichoke is a Ruby made with Rust.

USAGE:
    artichoke [OPTIONS] [ARGS]

ARGS:
    <programfile>
    <arguments>...

OPTIONS:
        --copyright                 print the copyright
    -e <commands>                   one line of script. Several -e's allowed. Omit [programfile]
    -h, --help                      Print help information
    -V, --version                   Print version information
        --with-fixture <fixture>    file whose contents will be read into the `$fixture` global
```

## Design and Goals

Artichoke is [designed to enable experimentation][artichoke-vision]. The top
goals of the project are:

- [Support WebAssembly as a build target][wasm-target].
- Support embedding and executing Ruby in untrusted environments.
- [Distribute Ruby applications as single-binary artifacts][a-single-binary].
- [Implement Ruby with state-of-the-art dependencies][a-deps].
- Experiment with VMs to support [dynamic codegen][a-codegen], [ahead of time
  compilation][a-compiler], [parallelism and eliminating the
  GIL][a-parallelism], and novel [memory management and garbage collection
  techniques][a-memory-management].

## Contributing

Artichoke aspires to be a Ruby 2.6.3-compatible implementation of the Ruby
programming language. [There is lots to do].

If Artichoke does not run Ruby source code in the same way that MRI does, it is
a bug and we would appreciate if you [filed an issue so we can fix it].

If you would like to contribute code üë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª, find an issue that looks interesting
and leave a comment that you're beginning to investigate. If there is no issue,
please file one before beginning to work on a PR. [Good first issues are labeled
`E-easy`].
